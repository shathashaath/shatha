      “My name is Shatha Shaath, and I’m currently looking for a job in youth services. I have 2 years of experience working with youth agencies. I have a bachelor’s degree in outdoor education. I consider myself a good public speaker, and I have a good sense of humor. “Who do you know who works with youth?”
