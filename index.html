                    <p> Inthis project we have practice everything we've learned so far by re-creating a real website using block and inline HTML elements, custom CSS, and Bootstrap classes.we Continued to keep an eye out for correct indentation, clear and
                        descriptive Git commit messages in the correct tense. We have used Bootstrap to rebuild the Wikipedia homepage. Using divs, spans, classes, floats, etc to style the page exactly as it appears in the browser. In addition we used
                        placeholder text and images in your project.

                    <p>Begin taking HTML to the next level by implementing <span style="color:blue">CSS</span> . Practice targeting elements for <span style="color:blue">CSS</span> rules, and trying out different <span style="color:blue">CSS</span> properties.
                        we made sure that the <span style="color:blue">CSS</span> stylesheet is in a sub-folder called <span style="color:blue">CSS</span> and that you correctly link the HTML document to the stylesheet</p>
